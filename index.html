        Although COVID-19 has been around since 2019, it is still a new disease
        for scientists and medical professionals. We are discovering new
        information about the disease every day. Amidst this constantly evolving
        situation, the best course of action is to be proactive when it comes to
        testing, treatment, and prevention of this disease
      </p>
      <p class="col-md-11">
        If you're experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in close
        contact with someone who has tested positive, it's important to seek
        medical attention and get tested. You also have the option to start a
        self-assessment test by answering a few questions that will help you
        choose the best course of action and save yourself or a loved one from
        the complications of this disease.

            >Covid Assessment Tool</a
          >
          is a free online self-assessment tool to determine the best care for
          yourself or a loved one based on your current health and risk factors.
          By answering a series of questions about your symptoms, exposure
          history, and underlying medical conditions, you can receive guidance
          on whether to seek medical treatment immediately or self-isolate at
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is highly recommended that you take this self-assessment seriously
          and follow the recommended steps given at the end to ensure the safety
          and health of yourself and others in your community.

              <strong> Why it is important to get tested for COVID </strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              Although medications are now available to treat COVID-19 and its
              symptoms, research shows that these drugs work best when taken
              within 5-7 days of experiencing symptoms. And while these
              medications are freely available for everyone regardless of their
              immigration status, you still need a prescription to get them.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, it's highly recommended that you know your current health
              status and are able to get access to the medicines as soon as
              possible particularly if you're at a high risk of contracting the
              disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting tested and seeking medical help on time is the only way to
              make sure you and your loved ones are safe from the complications
              of COVID-19. It is therefore imperative that you assess the risk
              and take preventive measures accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also important to use the tool again to see if your risk has
              changed since the last time you self-assessed for COVID-related
              complications. Keep it handy so you can use it from time to time
              and get guidance about what to do next if you're at a high risk of
              contracting the disease.
